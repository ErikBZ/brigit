Diana:
    I didn't want to be the one to forget**
Diego:
    I thought of everything I'd never regret**

@player:
    A little time with you is all the I get*->Chorus
    That's all we need because that's all we can take*->{
        Diego:
            One thing I never see the same when you're round**
    }
    I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground*
    I wanna take you back to the place by the rock**

Diana:
    But no one gives us time anymore

>DiegoBranch{
    Diego:
        I listened to your problems
        now listen to mine*
        I hold on because for you my heart keeps beating**
}

Diego:
    Will you be my light?**
